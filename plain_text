This file contains seven messages that are used to test cipher and decipher
This is the second message and there are five messages below this one
Previous one is the second message and following is the third message
One Time Pad Algorithm is a simple algorithm used to cipher some message
You should not use the key more than once when using one time pad algorithm
Otherwise the attacker can do xor and gain some knowledge about these message
This is the last message I will use and there are six messages above this
